<p>We put students in the driver's seat-tutoring specific to your subject,
   your question, around your schedule. And they love it, you will too.

<p>
   <b class="mytitle"> Our philosophy</b>
 </p>  
<p class="mycontent">
 
 While it's alays great to meet to face when it's possible,  in today's world, 
 online tutoring is the way to go. Even when we're not in an era of social distancing,
 <br>
 there is nothing like calling up a tutor on-demand.  
</p>

<p>
 The best online tutoring websites have thousands of instructors at every student's beck-and-call, so kids can call up 
 homework help if they're up at 3 a.m cramming or having a 15 minute window before heading to teen-friendly summer jobs.
 And since the schedules are so flexible and require less of a time commitment(and don't involve a commute to a physical location),
 this sites can attract better instructors, with many holding advanced degrees, in their stated subject areas.
